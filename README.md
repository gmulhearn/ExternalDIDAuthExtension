# External DID Authenticator Browser Extension
This browser extension is designed to be paired with the android DID authenticator app - [avaliable here](www.google.com).

This extension pairs with the app and communicates over webRTC whenever DID authentication (with webauthn) or some DID functionality is required - i.e. for DIDComm.

## Functionality
### WebAuthn Authenticator
The primary goal of this app/extension pair is to allow for webauthn registrations and authenticator to be performed using a decentralised identity instead of a randomly made keypair.

### DIDComm
